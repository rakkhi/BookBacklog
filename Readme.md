My process is just to capture a good book or recommendation when I see it here. Used to be a google keep list now moved to markdown. I just get the books on Audible mostly to listen when I'm doing something with my body that leaves my mind free e.g. housework or gardening. I used to move at quite a rapid pace but slowed a lot in the last few years. Hoping to pickup again. Quality and impact to me over quantity though.

Feel free to suggest, add, change anything via PR.
